# Final Capstone

This was a final capstone or final project that was completed by myself and a team of 3 other students. We were tasked with creating a web application that anonymous useres could report potholes in their community. It also allowed users to manage the reported potholes and schedule them for repair and see statistics about reported potholes.

For Security the Google API-KEY is not included in the project. Must be added aftet download.
